            We Need a Plan for How to Have Casual Sex Again

          ,” writer Mathew Rodriguez suggested, “[in] the absence of
          physical contact, many people have found creative ways to
          express their sexuality...people have used technology to
          have sex in an epidemic in a way that was not available to
          people, especially queer people, during the AIDS epidemic”
          (2020). As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, comparisons to
          the HIV/AIDS crisis were a common theme in popular media and
          mainstream news reportage about the current crisis. In the
          early days of lockdowns and quarantine orders in North
          America, queer-identified men who lived through the HIV/AIDS
          crisis shared their reflections on the resonances and
          differences between the present moment and their past lived
          experience. Writers and activists have resisted against easy
          comparisons between the two public health crises, noting
          that such equivocations would erase the stigma experienced
          by people living with HIV/AIDS.

          Nevertheless, despite critical differences, the memories and
          lessons of the public health response to the HIV/AIDS
          epidemic – particularly as it was experienced by
          queer-identified men and men who have sex with men (MSM) –
          provides a critical framework through which to examine the
          emergent responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout this
          pandemic, MSM who lived through the HIV/AIDS crisis have
          continued to link their experiences in the 1980s/90s to the
          marginalization, trauma, and risk assessments about casual
          sex occurring in the face of COVID-19.

          A critical goal of this speaker series is to create a space
          for the sharing of insights and information between
          academics and non-academics who work at the intersection of
          queer men’s sexual health and HIV/AIDS. The series addresses
          how sex, sexuality, and intimacy may be conceived of by
          queer men and MSM within the context of the COVID-19 global
          pandemic. As this pandemic becomes more protracted, the
          reality of ‘how to have casual sex again’ has been taken up
          on numerous fronts from activist sites (such as “What Would
          an HIV Doula Do?”) to governments worldwide to local and
          international HIV/AIDS organizations.

          With reference to the cultural history and memory of the
          AIDS crisis, and its varied effects on different communities
          and geographies, this series explores how these men and
          their allies are thinking critically regarding this specific
          history and its applicability to the COVID-19 pandemic. We
          explore the suggestion posed by Rodriguez and provide a
          platform for critical dialogue and reflection amongst
          academic, student, activist, service provider, and general
          audiences. The series examines themes of queer men’s
          framings and assessments of risk, policing, race, history,
          memory, technologies of mediation/connection, and art and
          aesthetics.

          This monthly series also facilitates an intersectoral
          exchange of ideas between academics working in the
          humanities and social sciences specializing in HIV/AIDS and
          epidemiology, front line service providers, specifically
          working with the systemic context of AIDS services
          organizations (ASOs), and general audiences. By reaching a
          diverse audience, it is hoped that it will be a benefit to
          public health discourse, as organizations and governments
          consider public safety measures around sexual practices more
          broadly outside of the HIV/AIDS context. Finally, the series
          may directly contribute to scholarship on queer men’s sex,
          sexuality, and intimacy in the context of health crises and
          will hopefully generate practical insights benefitting AIDS
          service organizations and public health providers.
