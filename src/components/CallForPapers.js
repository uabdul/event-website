          Leo Bersani opens his now-canonical essay “Is the Rectum a
          Grave?” with what some might consider an ostensibly wild
          declaration: ‘There is a big secret about sex: most people
          don’t like it’ (1987, 197). Excoriatingly written in the
          early days of the AIDS crisis, the essay sets the stage for
          a kind of thinking that situates sex and sexuality up
          against and alongside the persistence and, dare it be said,
          insistence of a deadly virus. The confluence of these two –
          sex life and viral contagion – would drastically and, in
          some ways, irrevocably rewrite the script of sex as we
          thought we knew it. From this traumatic event in the history
          of sex, new meanings, patterns, and ways of thinking and
          having it would evolve and emerge.

          Nearly four decades since the first known and reported cases
          of HIV, we find ourselves again in the midst of a global
          health crisis—the COVID-19 pandemic. While caution must be
          taken when instituting seemingly easy comparisons between
          the AIDS crisis and the present coronavirus pandemic, this
          collection of essays will attempt to tackle the question of
          what it means to confront one’s desires in the burgeoning
          context of a viral contagion. What does it mean to navigate
          the tenuous terrain of our individual and collective
          libidinal drives in this moment? What do we make of the
          structure of fantasy and the nature of intimacy in this
          contemporary scene? How will sex and its meanings be again
          undone and then remade within the context of this viral
          presence? What does a contagion have to say about, or do
          with, searching for or accessing pleasure—jouissance, in
          possibly its most distilled sense? If sex is an encounter
          between oneself and an other, or several others, do viruses
          come to constitute a new kind or form of otherness?

          Returning to Bersani’s opening statement, why might, as he
          suggested, ‘most people [not] like it?’ To build on this,
          what might we infer from such a statement in midst of yet
          another pandemic? What sorts of creative, theoretical,
          ontological, and epistemological possibilities may there be
          in thinking sex life and viral life side-by-side? Is sex
          always already an encounter with questions concerning risk?
          Is risk here, a stand-in, for what Lauren Berlant and Lee
          Edelman called the “unbearable”? How do we make sense of our
          near-insatiable desire for this thing in the face of
          possible death? Sex is never just about fucking; it is
          always already about both more and less than that. Perhaps
          in the final analysis, like Berlant and Edelman have
          suggested, we must ‘approach sex here as a site, therefore,
          at which relationality is invested with hopes, expectations,
          and anxieties that are often experienced as unbearable’
          (2014, 1). In a viral context, is there an emergent set of
          ethics (of risk, relationality, pleasure, etc.), politics
          (of surveillance, immunity, sovereignty, and so on), and
          discursive practices at the confluence of this unbearable
          kind of relationality and the death drive?

          It is with these provocations and questions in mind that you
          are invited to submit to this collection which will explore
          the intersection between sex and the current health crisis.
          At its core, this will be an attempt to look closely at how
          the sexual and the erotic become reconstituted as a
          miniscule pathogen makes its way across communities, both
          local and global. The sexual and erotic will be defined here
          as expansive terms that include a wide array of
          possibilities, preferences, and proclivities, reflective of
          an inexhaustible range of opportunities. It is hoped that
          this collection will reflect diversity in the sexual and the
          erotic not so much for diversity’s own representative sake,
          but as an ethos upon which these categories are already
          implicitly established.

          The University of Regina Press encourages that the volume’s
          contributors, in writing their respective chapters, strive
          to reach an intended readership beyond the exclusivity of a
          scholarly one. As such, it is hoped that the ideas conveyed
          in this volume be accessible to both the scholarly reader
          and the well-educated, informed, yet non-academic
          reader/scholar. The Press makes it a top priority to bring
          rigorous and important work being done in the academy to the
          wider realm of readers and interlocutors. It is also worth
          noting that the previous books published in URP’s “The
          Exquisite Corpse Book Series,” of which this collection
          seeks to be a part, have been co-published by ZED Books in
          the U.K., now Bloomsbury Publishing.
